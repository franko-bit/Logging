What is Logging?
Logging is the act of recording messages or events from a software application. These messages are saved in places like database or remote server,etc.
Why we need logging?
Monitoring and Maintenance
Performance Monitoring: Logs can track how well the application is performing, such as how long tasks take and how much memory or CPU is used.
Health Monitoring: Continuous logging allows administrators to ensure the application is running smoothly.
Security and Compliance
Security Audits: Logs can record security events like login attempts or access to sensitive data, which are important for security checks.
Compliance: Certain industries require detailed logs to meet legal standards.
Operational Insights
User Behavior: Logs show how users interact with the application, helping to improve the user experience.
System Behavior: Logs help understand how the system behaves under different conditions, which is useful for planning and improving performance.
Auditing and Accountability
Change Tracking: Logs record changes to the system, providing a trail of what was changed, when, and by whom.
User Actions: Logging user actions can trace any harmful or unintended activities.
Communication
Collaboration: Logs provide a common reference point for development, operations, and support teams when discussing issues and solutions.
Debugging and Troubleshooting
Identifying Issues: Logs help find problems in the application by showing detailed information about what was happening when the problem occurred.
Error Tracking: Developers can track errors by looking at logs, which often include error messages and details about what went wrong.
Automation and Alerting
Automated Alerts: Logs can trigger alerts and actions automatically based on specific conditions.
Event-Driven Actions: Certain events in logs can start automated workflows or responses, making incident management more efficient.
Understanding Logging Levels
INFO: General information about the progress of the application.
WARN: Shows potentially harmful situations that aren't errors but could lead to problems.
ERROR: Indicates problems that might allow the application to keep running but need attention.
TRACE: The most detailed level, used for very fine details that help debug an application.
DEBUG: Less detailed than TRACE but still provides a lot of information for debugging.
FATAL: Very serious errors that usually cause the application to stop running.
